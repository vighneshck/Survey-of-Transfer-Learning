# A Survey of Transfer Learning

The submitted code is a single ipython notebook, containing codes for running:

(i) SRCONLY  
(ii) TGTONLY  
(iii) ALL  
(iv) WEIGHTED  
(v) PRED  
(vi) LININT  
(vii) FEDA  
(viii) a variant of TrAdaBoost  

To open the ipython notebook for execution, type the following on the command line:

`$ jupyter notebook SML_Code_1103842.ipynb`

OR, you can alternatively mount the ipython notebook on Google Colab directly.

In the ipython notebook that opens up, run the following sections of the code in the same order specified:

(i) Setting up colab  
(ii) Importing modules  
(iii) Reading csv files  
(iv) Data partition  
(v) Task 1.1 (Implement all 6 Baseline methods)  
(vi) Task 1.2 (Implement FEDA)  
(vii) Task 2 (Implement your own model)
